          This is a React and PIXI.js implementation of the classic game memory, which demonstrates using
          the React component lifecycle to control a PIXI.js canvas. Additionally, it uses Redux for state
          management and Redux Sagas for handling side effects. The images are fetched from the public Pixabay
          API. <a href="https://github.com/dustin-cooler/examples/tree/master/react-pixi-memory">View the source on GitHub.</a>

          I used this technique to recreate an interactive sales demo for a client. The original had been
          written in Flash and ported to javascript/HTML, but was unmaintainable because the client did not
          have the source .fla and the javascript version was uglified to the point of being nearly unreadable.
          Once the javascript port started failing in newer browsers, it became apparent that the best course
          would be to just recreate the sales piece from scratch. Due to time and budget constraints, I had less
          than a week to pull it off. After researching options, I decided to use PIXI.js to handle the animations
          and React/Redux to handle state and the html content of the demo. React made sense because I had just
          finished a major React project and had no ramp-up time to switch to something else, and PIXI would let
          me implement the various animations more performantly and with less code than using CSS or using canvas
          directly. Plus, PIXI is well-documented and has plenty of examples I could use for reference.
